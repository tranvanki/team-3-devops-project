# STUDENT TODO: Create a Multi-Stage Dockerfile
# ===========================================
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Stage 1 (builder):
#    - Use node:18-alpine as base
#    - Set working directory
#    - Copy package files and install ALL dependencies
#    - Copy source code
#
# 2. Stage 2 (production):
#    - Use node:18-alpine as base
#    - Set working directory
#    - Copy only package files from builder
#    - Install ONLY production dependencies (hint: --only=production)
#    - Copy application code from builder
#    - Expose the correct port
#    - Set the start command
#
# Hints:
# - Research: "Docker multi-stage build Node.js"
# - Use COPY --from=builder to copy between stages
# - Final image should be as small as possible
# ===========================================

# Stage 1: builder
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package manifests and install all deps
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./
RUN npm ci --silent || npm install --production --silent

# Copy source
COPY . .

# Stage 2: production image
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app

# Create non-root user
RUN addgroup -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -G appgroup

# Copy node_modules and app from builder
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app .

USER appuser
ENV NODE_ENV=production
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
